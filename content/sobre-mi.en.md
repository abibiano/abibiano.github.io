summary: Photography Enthusiast and Software Engineer as profession
---

Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Alex Bibiano and I started taking my first picture when I was about 8 years old with a Canon AE-1 from my father. I remember that he let me user it for the first time in a carnival parade in Schwetzingen (Germany) to take my first photos. Since then, I have been exploring the world of photography, first with film cameras and black and white development, and later with different digital cameras and digital development.

Professionally, I work as a software engineer, and you can see a more general description of my profile on LinkedIn. However, photography and my family have always been my two passions and I have dedicated myself to photography with enthusiasm whenever time has allowed me.

I am lucky to have a family home in a privileged natural environment such as the Caurel mountain range in Galicia, which has led me to develop my interest in nature photography. In addition, having three children and belonging to a photographic association for years, has opened my field of interest to other types of photography such as wildlife, macro, architecture, newborns, and others. These are the types of photographs you will find in my portfolio.
