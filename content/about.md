Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Alex Bibiano and I started taking my first picture when I was about 8 years old with a Canon AE-1 from my father. I remember that he let me user it for the first time in a carnival parade in Schwetzingen (Germany) to take my first photos. Since then, I have been exploring the world of photography, first with film cameras and black and white development, and later with different digital cameras and digital development.

Professionally, I work as a software engineer, and you can see a more general description of my profile on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abibiano/?locale=en_US). However, photography and my family have always been my two passions and I have dedicated myself to photography with enthusiasm whenever time has allowed me.

I am lucky to have a family home in a privileged natural environment such as the Caurel mountain range in Galicia, which has led me to develop my interest in nature photography. In addition, having three children and belonging to a photographic association for years, has opened my field of interest to other types of photography such as wildlife, macro, architecture, newborns, and others.

In recent years, I've developed a growing passion for still life photography. Through specialized workshops, including the renowned [Harold Ross Fine Art Photography](http://haroldrossfineart.com), I've significantly evolved in this area. This journey has allowed me to explore the intricate interplay of light and shadow, composition, and storytelling through carefully crafted still life scenes. These experiences have greatly influenced my photographic style and approach, adding another dimension to the variety of work you'll find in my portfolio.
